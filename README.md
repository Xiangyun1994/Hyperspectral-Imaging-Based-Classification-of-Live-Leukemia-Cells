# Hyperspectral-Imaging-Based-Classification-of-Live-Leukemia-Cells
This repository contains example implementation code for 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN models used for hyperspectral image classification.
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the full dataset (~6.5GB) is not included in this repository. If you are interested in accessing the dataset for research or evaluation purposes, feel free to contact me via email: [mxy1994@tju.edu.cn]. I will be happy to share the data upon request.
